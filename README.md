# BookLog
Building this to learn. A Javascript and Vue.js app to keep track of what books our family reads.

I'll be using this as a practical way to implement things I'm learning into something that my
family will actually use.

## Things this app will do

* Have user accounts for each family member
* User will be able to record:
   * What books they are currently reading
   * What books they have read (start, finish dates)
      * Notes, or report, on books they've read
   * To Be Read list, what books they want to read
* A list of books, which can be added to by users

## Tech used

This is a learning project, so I want to use the things I'd like to learn.

I've realized that I need to understand databases better and know how to
use them. So I'll be using MongoDB. I also need to use node.js on the
backend. I'll be going through a course on all this on Udemy.

* node.js
* MongoDB
* Vue.js
